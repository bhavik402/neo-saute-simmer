# 🥣 Instructions

- For garlic paste, you can blend it, pestle and mortar, or microplane
> Microplane works the best and takes less time  
- Mix all ingredients for marinade in a separate bowl/container
- Optional (for chicken breast)
	- Use meat mallet to thin out chicken breast or lay the piece down flat and cut from the middle laterally
	- If you are using any other cuts, do not slice or use meat mallet
- Coat the chicken pieces with marinade well
- Let it rest for up to 24hrs but at least an hour
- Bring chicken to room temperature before cooking (takes about an hour at room temps) this keeps chicken from drying out during cooking process
