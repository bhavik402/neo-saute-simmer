# 🥣 Instructions

1. Heat up blueberries in microwave/stove for about a 30 seconds to a minute
2. Mix with Cottage Cheese and blend it with blue berries
> Blending cottage cheese will yield smooth consistency similar to yogurt. 
> Hand blender works great for this use case, but counter top blender works as well
3. Mix Greek Yogurt and mix well

# 💬 Comments
- can be modified to include high protein, carbs and/or fat
  - Protein: whey/casein protein powder (unflavored/flavored), collagen peptides, etc.
  - Carbs: ideally fruits works best here but you can include some vegetables?
  - Fat: Nuts/Seeds are great way to include fats
- Ideally can be consumed before going to sleep due to slow digesting casein protein in cottage cheese
