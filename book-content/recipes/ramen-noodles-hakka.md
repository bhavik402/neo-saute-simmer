> You can add more veggies but too much may dilute the flavor, Bell pepper and onions will most likely be uncooked so slightly sauté them if you decide to include it in this recipe
# 🥣 Instructions

1. Boil the noodles or soak it in hot water, (do not mix )
> Soaking noodles in hot water works really well, takes longer but yields perfect "doneness" 
2. Once noodles are cooked to your preference (i.e. al dente, well done), drain all the water as much as possible
3. Mix noodles packet that comes with it
4. Mix `1/2 Tbsp` of Bang Bang Seasoning
