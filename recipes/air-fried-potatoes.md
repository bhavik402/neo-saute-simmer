## Instructions

1. Peel, slice or dice potatoes (any cuts will do)
2. Rinse out the starch
3. Throw it in air fryer to dry it, by setting air fryer at 400 degrees and 15 minutes
4. After 2-3 minutes pull out the potatoes into a mixing bowl 
5. Add olive oil and mix well, keep in mind more olive oil will not necessarily yield crispy potatoes with the same amount of cook time
6. Throw it back in to air fryer, resume and finish cooking
7. Toss/flip potatoes half way through the cooking process, so potatoes in the bottom cook evenly
